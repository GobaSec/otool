TextMate bundle for otool/otx generated files

This is a work in progress and currently works very well for me on my otx files.  

While all of the assembly instructions in the files I have dissassembled are included in the highlighting,
there are still a considerable amount which are not added. If the assembly instructions in your files are not 
highlighted feel free to add them yourself or comment/commit.  

I hope this works for you as well as it has worked for me.
